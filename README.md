**Command Design Pattern**

Problem Statement - In complex software systems, business workflows often involved the multiple operations like
1. Service calls
2. Validations
3. Database operations
4. Transformations
5. Third party integrations

In system where multiple operations need to be done one after another, the logic often becomes hard to mange , difficult to test and not reusable.
You may end up writing all the steps in a single method and class  These operations are typically implemented in Monolithic method resulting in:

1. Long and Hard to understand Hard-to-read and hard-to-maintain code
2. Difficult to change one step without affecting others
3. Not flexible for future changes
4. Repetitive error handling and logging logic
5. Poor testability due to tightly coupled logic
6. Limited reusability of business components

This is especially a problem in workflows like placing an order in an e-commerce app, where each step depends on different services and data.

Example without Command Pattern :

public void placeOrder(){
validateUser();
fetchCartData();
fetchCheckoutData();
reservationSlot();
pricingService();
makePayment();
saveOrder();
sendBackResponse();
}

If something changes like new step is added or one service changes , you will have to modify this method and potentially affect the entire flow

Solution : Break each step into a small, reusable command that only handles one specific task. The command design pattern addresses this by encapsulating each operations into command object

Benefits -
1. Separation of concerns - Each command handle single , focused task , Clear separation logic per step
2. Reuability - Commands can be reused and across the flow
3. Easily build complex flows from smaller commands
4. Each command can be wrapped with logging , matrics and tracing
5. Commands can unit tested in isolation. Easily test individuals common units
6. Extensibility -> add future saga rollback or audit hooks.
7. Flexibility run independent step in parallel

Architectural digram

Request handler —> Command executor -> command-1, command-2, command-3 —>  external service  DB / API

Example Architectural digram
Client request  —> Controller —> Command Executor - step by step coordination ->
1. ValidationCommand
2. CheckoutService Command
3. ReservationCommand
4. SubscriptionServiceCommand
5. UserPreferenceServiceCommand
6. TaxOrPriceServiceCommand
7. PaymentCommand
8. SaveOrderCommand
9. PublishEventCOmmnd
10. OrderResponseCommand
